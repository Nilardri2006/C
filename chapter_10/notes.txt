when we write a aprogram the program makes a exe
and that load in RAM and then executed and after that
the RAM deletes that data

c program can be written and read by FILE

FILE is a sructure which is needed to be created after opening the FILE

as we close fridge after opening like this we need to closea file
after opening it using fclose.....to say os that we r done with this file


write mode always make the just made file empty and then rewrites 
according to the code
